### Description
This App extracts the region of interest from breast mammogram images. Basically, this app removes pectoral muscle and background which represent any artifact present outside the breast area, such as patient markings. The experimental results showed that there is significant speedup, near to seven times, in algorithm execution on DFE compared to the general purpose processor.
